# skill-overrides.toml - Frontmatter overrides applied during build
#
# Keys are skill names. Values are YAML frontmatter fields to add or replace.
# Applied after frontmatter normalization. Useful for overriding fields on
# external skills without forking upstream repos.
#
# Example:
#
# [some-external-skill]
# disable-model-invocation = true
#
# [another-skill]
# description = "Override the description during build"
